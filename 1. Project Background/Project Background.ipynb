    "    This project explores the extent to which macroeconomic variables predict movements in major U.S. stock indices — specifically the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones, and NASDAQ. By leveraging historical data, we aim to quantify the influence of variables such as unemployment rate, GDP growth, money supply, inflation, interest rates, and federal policy actions on market behavior.\n",
