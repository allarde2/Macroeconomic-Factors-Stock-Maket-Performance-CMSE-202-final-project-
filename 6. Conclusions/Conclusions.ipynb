    "  Our analysis finds that macroeconomic factors explain a substantial portion of variation in all three major U.S. stock indices over time, with R-squared values as high as 0.958 for the Dow Jones and 0.935 for the S&amp;P 500 using multiple linear regression. Across all models, <strong>Unemployment Rate</strong> and <strong>GDP Growth</strong> consistently emerged as the most influential predictors, while <strong>M2 Money Supply</strong> also showed strong predictive power, particularly in Lasso and Time Series models. Although CPI and Federal Funds Rate occasionally appeared significant, they were less consistently important, and models using differencing significantly improved prediction accuracy by capturing temporal momentum and macroeconomic shocks.\n",
